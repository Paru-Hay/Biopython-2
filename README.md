# Biopython-2
This is the day 2 python, where we will be working with the dna and protein sequences as to how to add the sequences, slice them, turning sequence objects into strings, changing to upper or lower case. We also work with the nucleotide sequences and complement them. And the session concludes with learning transcription of DNA sequences to RNA.
